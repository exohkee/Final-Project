                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>My most favorite thing in the whole world is playing Video Games. You can say I have become a self made pro. 
                    At least my mom thinks so! I started out in the world of Minecraft and really enjoyed the way you could 
                    create new worlds and explore ones made by others. My newest two favorite games though are Roblox and RecRoom!
                    With both Roblox and Recroom I am able to play a multitude of games and mini worlds that I am able to explore,
                    with my favorite currently being anything with Hello Neighbor or Scary Obby!</p>

                <h3>Fantasy Play</h3>
                <p>Another thing I am really into is Fantasy play or Role Playing. I am a very good actor and often get my mom
                    to join me on my adventures into the world of Hello Neighbor or even action play fighting. My all time favorite thing
                    to act out with my mom or others would be Mortal Combat. I really love the different characters that you are able to choose
                    from as well as the multitude of moves and weapon choices to choose from. Each round in the Mortal Combat game
                    starts with a new round and commentary that I am able act out. My mom also enjoys all the cool moves we do together. </p>
